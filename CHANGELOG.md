## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Home load history timezone handling**: the optimization loop built its 24h look-back window with a naive `datetime.now()`, clashing with the timezone-aware (UTC) timestamps returned by Home Assistant and the persistence layer and raising "can't compare offset-naive and offset-aware datetimes". The look-back window, the merged-consumption timestamp and the history purge cut-off now use UTC-aware timestamps consistently (`optimization_service.py`, `home_load_history_service.py`).
- Unified the dashboard background color with the rest of the interface: the main content area now uses the same grey (`base-100`) as the sidebar, cards, top bar, and bottom bar instead of a lighter `base-200`, reinforcing the flat visual style (#32).

### Added

- Global Home Assistant connection status indicator in the bottom bar, always visible: green when connected, red when disconnected or not configured. Clicking it opens a popover with the per-service status detail and a button to jump straight to the Home Assistant settings (the External Services page lands pre-filtered on the relevant adapter) (#20).
- Unit-of-measure fields in configuration forms are now selected through a segmented control (e.g. `W` / `kW` / `MW`, `Wh` / `kWh` / `MWh`, `GH/s` / `TH/s` / `PH/s`) instead of a free-text input, preventing inconsistent or invalid values. The available options are inferred automatically from each field, so the control applies to every configuration form (#18).
- Home Assistant entity fields now show a selectable entity-domain prefix (e.g. `sensor.`, `switch.`) as a dropdown next to the input, so the user only types the entity object id. The domain defaults to the one derived from the field's value/default/name and can be overridden, with the prefix now enabled on Forecast Provider and Miner Controller forms too (handling controllers that mix `switch.` and `sensor.` entities) (#39).
- **Additive history backfill on manual collection**: a manual per-device collection now re-fetches the whole requested look-back window from the provider and merges it into the store (de-duplicated by the `(device_id, timestamp)` primary key), filling internal gaps without dropping existing data. Previously it only ingested incrementally from the last stored point, ignoring `lookback_hours`. `EnergyLoadHistoryProviderPort.get_power_points` gains a `force_refresh` flag; the scheduled collection stays incremental (`ports.py`, `home_assistant_api_history.py`, `home_load_history_service.py`).
- **Forecast retrain after manual collection**: the device history modal prompts the user to retrain the device's forecast model with the freshly collected data, triggering per-device training and refreshing the forecast on success (frontend).
- **Training outcome reporting** (`LoadTrainingResult` value object in `domain/home_load/value_objects.py`): `train_device` now reports whether a model was actually `trained` (with best adapter, MAE and sample count), `skipped` (with reason, e.g. insufficient history) or `failed`. The `training/trigger` endpoint surfaces the outcome and the UI shows a status toast, instead of always reporting a generic "completed".
- **Miner controller connection test** (`edge_mining/adapters/domain/miner/`):
  - New `POST /miner-controllers/test-connection` endpoint that tests a (non-persisted) controller configuration and returns a reachability result (`MinerControllerTestConnectionSchema`)
  - `MinerActionService.test_miner_controller_connection()` builds a fresh, uncached adapter from the controller entity and verifies the device responds (status / hashrate / power / device info)
  - `AdapterService.build_miner_controller_adapter()` to instantiate an adapter from a controller entity without using or polluting the adapters cache
  - Frontend: "Test Connection" button in the miner controller form, shown only for the PyASIC adapter type, with inline success/error feedback (#46)
- Configure and order controller features directly in the miner creation form, before the miner is saved (#48):
  - New REST endpoint `GET /miner-controllers/{controller_id}/supported-features` returning the feature types a controller supports, without requiring a persisted miner (`MinerActionService.get_controller_supported_features`).
  - The "Add Miner" form now shows a controller's features as soon as it is selected (with the backend defaults: enabled, priority 50), so priority and enabled/disabled state can be set during creation.
  - On save, the chosen priority/enabled values are applied after the controllers are linked. This also works for controllers newly added to an existing miner, without requiring a second save.
- Fetch device data (max hash rate, max power and model/hostname) from the controller while creating a miner, without saving it first (#49):
  - New REST endpoints `GET /miner-controllers/{controller_id}/limits` and `GET /miner-controllers/{controller_id}/info`, backed by `MinerActionService.get_controller_limits` / `get_controller_info`, which query a controller directly via a temporary miner.
  - The "Add Miner" form now enables the "fetch from miner" buttons for Max Hash Rate, Max Power and Model when at least one controller is selected, trying the selected controllers until one provides the value.
- **Heat Management (Climate domain)** — manage heat as a primary asset, driving mining to keep a space at a target temperature (#44):
  - `ClimateZone` (room/area to heat) and `ClimateMonitor` (temperature sensor) with daily temperature schedule, hysteresis and default target
  - Climate monitor adapters: Home Assistant API and Dummy
  - Climate zones can be attached to an optimization unit; the optimizer collects per-zone readings and exposes the thermal state to the rule engine, so policies can drive mining toward the target temperature
  - Example "Solar Surplus Room Heating" policy
  - Frontend: climate zones/monitors management and a climate dashboard

### Changed

- Reorganized configuration forms for readability: each entity field is now paired with its unit of measure on the same row, and fields are grouped by domain (Power / Energy) when at least two domains are present, preserving the chronological order within each group. Applied generically to all schema-driven configuration forms (#17).
- Paired entity/unit fields now use a compact layout: the unit segmented control is rendered inline next to the entity input, so each row keeps a single label and helper text and stays aligned regardless of text length. Configuration modals were widened for more breathing room (#17).
- Miner controller add/edit form now uses the shared schema-driven configuration form, so Home Assistant controllers (e.g. generic socket) benefit from entity/unit pairing and the unit segmented controls like the other forms (#17, #18).
- Cleaned up sidebar header: removed the "Edge Mining" text label and the username placeholder, left-aligned the logo with the sidebar menu items, and refined the green glow to originate from the logo area (#33).
- `MinerActionService`: extracted shared `_read_miner_info` / `_read_miner_limits`helpers and a `_temp_miner_for_controller` builder, reused by the miner- and controller-level info/limits/details reads.
- Restructured the root `README.md` into an overview-first layout (project description, features, ecosystem, quick start with collapsible commands, documentation index) and moved the detailed installation, configuration and operations content into a new `docs/INSTALL.md`. Added a 256x256 project logo (`images/logo.png` and its `images/logo.svg` source) generated from the frontend mark.

## [Pre-Release Rev3]

### Added

- **Mining Performance Analysis Domain** (`edge_mining/domain/performance/`):
  - Value objects: `MiningReward`, `PoolWorkerStats`, `PoolStats`, `PayoutSchedule` in `value_objects.py` (renamed from misspelled `values_objects.py`)
  - Entity `MiningSession` for tracking aggregated mining activity (`entities.py`)
  - Common types: `PayoutFrequency` enum, `Satoshi` NewType (`common.py`)
  - Domain exceptions: `MiningPoolUnreachableError`, `MiningPoolAuthError`, `MiningPoolResponseError`
  - Domain events: `RewardReceivedEvent`, `HashrateDropDetectedEvent` (`events.py`)
  - Async `MiningPerformanceTrackerPort` contract for live pool data (stats, rewards history, payout schedule, workers)

- **Pool Tracker Adapters** (`edge_mining/adapters/domain/performance/trackers/`):
  - `OceanMiningPerformanceTracker` — public Ocean pool API integration (no authentication, Bitcoin address based)
  - `BraiinsPoolMiningPerformanceTracker` — Braiins Pool v1 API integration using `Pool-Auth-Token` header
  - Corresponding adapter factories (`OceanMiningPerformanceTrackerFactory`, `BraiinsPoolMiningPerformanceTrackerFactory`)
  - Abstract `MiningPerformanceTrackerAdapterFactory` in `shared/interfaces/factories.py`

- **REST API** (`edge_mining/adapters/domain/performance/fast_api/router.py`):
  - 13 endpoints under `/api/v1` covering tracker CRUD, type discovery, config schema inspection, external service listing, connectivity test, live stats, workers, rewards history, payout schedule
  - Error mapping: `MiningPoolAuthError` → 401, `MiningPoolUnreachableError` → 503, `MiningPoolResponseError` → 502, `NotFoundError` → 404, `ConfigurationError` → 400

- **Pydantic Schemas** (`edge_mining/adapters/domain/performance/schemas.py`):
  - Tracker CRUD schemas with `to_model`/`from_model` converters
  - Per-adapter config schemas (Dummy, Ocean requires `bitcoin_address`, Braiins Pool requires `api_token`) + `MINING_PERFORMANCE_TRACKER_CONFIG_SCHEMA_MAP`
  - Response schemas: `HashRateSchema`, `PoolWorkerStatsSchema`, `PoolStatsSchema`, `MiningRewardSchema`, `PayoutScheduleSchema`, `MiningPerformanceSnapshotSchema` (all with both `from_model` and `to_model`)

- **MiningPerformanceSnapshot Value Object** (`edge_mining/domain/performance/value_objects.py`):
  - Consolidated snapshot grouping `current_hashrate` + `pool_stats` + `payout_schedule` under a single `timestamp`, following the same pattern as `EnergyStateSnapshot` and `MinerStateSnapshot`
  - Exposed to the rule engine via the new `DecisionalContext.mining_performance` field — enables rules on aggregated metrics (24h/7d average hashrate, unpaid balance, estimated next payout, payout frequency/threshold)

- **Interactive CLI** (`edge_mining/adapters/domain/performance/cli/commands.py`):
  - New main menu option "Manage Mining Performance Trackers" (list, create, update, delete, test, show stats/workers/rewards/payout)
  - Adapter-aware configuration wizard with dict-dispatch handler map
  - Async-to-sync bridging via `run_async_func` helper

- **Configuration & Wiring**:
  - `MINING_PERFORMANCE_TRACKER_CONFIG_TYPE_MAP` and `MINING_PERFORMANCE_TRACKER_EXTERNAL_SERVICE_MAP` in `shared/adapter_maps/performance.py`
  - New adapter configs (`DummyMiningPerformanceTrackerConfig`, `OceanMiningPerformanceTrackerConfig`, `BraiinsPoolMiningPerformanceTrackerConfig`)
  - Nine new `ConfigurationService` methods for tracker lifecycle management
  - `ConfigurationUpdatedEventType.MINING_PERFORMANCE_TRACKER` event type
  - `adapter_service.py` registers the three tracker factories

- **Shared Helper** (`edge_mining/domain/common.py`):
  - `utc_now_timestamp()` function to produce fresh `Timestamp` values for dataclass `default_factory` usage

- **Rate-limit / caching layer for pool trackers** (`edge_mining/adapters/domain/performance/trackers/_base.py`):
  - New shared base class `CachedRateLimitedTrackerBase` providing per-method TTL caching and exponential backoff (5s / 10s / 20s / 40s / 80s with ±20% jitter) around HTTP 429 responses
  - `MiningPoolRateLimitedError` domain exception (with optional `retry_after` hint) raised when the pool signals throttling; mapped to HTTP 429 by the REST router (including `Retry-After` response header) and displayed with hint in the CLI
  - Stale-while-error fallback: when all retries are exhausted a cached value — even if past its TTL — is served in preference to propagating the error; the error is only re-raised when no cached value exists
  - In-memory cache keyed by `(method_name, args_tuple)` so methods with arguments (e.g. `get_recent_rewards(limit)`) get separate cache slots
  - TTL tables (`TTL_MAP`) tuned per pool: hashrate 60s, pool/worker stats 300s (worker data updates every ~5 min upstream), recent rewards 600s, payout schedule 3600s
  - Applied transparently to both `OceanMiningPerformanceTracker` and `BraiinsPoolMiningPerformanceTracker`; `_get()` detects 429 before any auth/5xx mapping and extracts `Retry-After`

- **Tests** — 107 new unit tests across tracker adapters, configuration service, REST router, and CLI commands
- **Tests** — 15 new unit tests for `CachedRateLimitedTrackerBase` (cache hit/miss, TTL expiry, backoff progression, stale-while-error, retry-after handling, cache invalidation) plus 429-detection tests for the Ocean and Braiins adapters

- **Home Load — Phase 3: DecisionalContext Integration**
  - Extended field resolver (`helpers.py`) with dict key lookup for `home_load.devices.<name>.*` paths and `None` guard for `Optional` intermediate fields
  - Pre-computed window properties on `LoadEnergyConsumption`: `next_1h`, `next_2h`, `next_4h`, `last_1h`, `last_4h`, `last_24h`
  - Example YAML rules: `home_load_start_rules.yaml` (3 rules), `home_load_stop_rules.yaml` (4 rules)
  - Fixed existing rules from `home_load_forecast` → `home_load.total_forecast.next_2h.avg_power`
  - 5 new unit tests for dict resolver

- **Home Load — Phase 4: ML Forecast Providers (Statsmodels + XGBoost)**
  - ML optional dependencies: `scikit-learn>=1.5.0`, `statsmodels>=0.14.0`, `xgboost>=2.0.0` in `[ml]` extras
  - `EnergyLoadForecastProviderAdapter.STATSMODELS` and `.XGBOOST` enum values
  - Config dataclasses: `EnergyLoadForecastProviderStatsmodelsConfig`, `EnergyLoadForecastProviderXGBoostConfig`
  - Feature engineering utilities (`features.py`): `intervals_to_hourly_series()`, `fill_missing_hours()`, `build_calendar_features()`, `build_lag_features()`, `prepare_supervised_dataset()`
  - `LoadConsumptionModel` entity with `model_bytes` (serialized pickle), MAE/RMSE metrics, `is_active` flag
  - `LoadConsumptionModelRepository` port + three implementations: InMemory, SQLite, SQLAlchemy
  - `load_consumption_models` database table with composite index on `(adapter_type, device_id, is_active)`
  - Alembic migration `c3d4e5f6a7b8` for `load_consumption_models` table
  - `StatsmodelsForecastProvider` (Holt-Winters exponential smoothing) with factory, lazy import
  - `XGBoostForecastProvider` (gradient boosting with calendar + lag features) with factory, lazy import
  - `LoadForecastModelTrainingService`: nightly batch training with holdout evaluation + best model promotion
  - Pydantic schemas: `EnergyLoadForecastProviderStatsmodelsConfigSchema`, `EnergyLoadForecastProviderXGBoostConfigSchema`
  - Scheduler cron job at 04:00 for nightly ML model training

- **Home Load — API Completion**
  - `ConfigurationServiceInterface`: 10 new abstract CRUD methods for `EnergyLoadForecastProvider` (5) and `EnergyLoadHistoryProvider` (5)
  - `ConfigurationService`: implemented `add_`, `get_`, `list_`, `update_`, `remove_energy_load_forecast_provider`
  - Completed 5 forecast provider REST endpoints (previously stubs returning 501/empty):
    - `GET /energy-load-forecast-providers` — list all providers
    - `POST /energy-load-forecast-providers` — create and persist provider
    - `GET /energy-load-forecast-providers/{id}` — get provider by ID
    - `PUT /energy-load-forecast-providers/{id}` — update provider with config deserialization
    - `DELETE /energy-load-forecast-providers/{id}` — remove provider

### Changed
- `MiningPerformanceTrackerPort` methods are now `async`; the dummy tracker adapter has been adapted accordingly
- `OptimizationService` now awaits `get_current_hashrate` calls to match the async port contract, and consolidates the three tracker calls behind a new private helper `_build_mining_performance_snapshot` that returns a single `MiningPerformanceSnapshot`
- Replaced `DecisionalContext.tracker_current_hashrate: Optional[HashRate]` with `mining_performance: Optional[MiningPerformanceSnapshot]`; `DecisionalContextSchema` and the rule engine `OPERATOR_EXAMPLES[LTE]` example updated accordingly (new field path: `mining_performance.current_hashrate.value`)
- Interactive CLI main menu: "Run all optimization units" shifted from option 8 to 9 to accommodate the new tracker menu at option 8
- Replaced per-module `_utc_now_timestamp()` helpers in `domain/performance/entities.py` and `domain/performance/value_objects.py` with the shared `utc_now_timestamp()` from `domain/common.py`
- `AdapterService`: new factory branches for STATSMODELS and XGBOOST with `model_repo` injection
- `PersistenceSettings`: added `load_consumption_model_repo` field
- `Services` dataclass: added `load_forecast_training_service` field
- `AutomationScheduler`: accepts optional `load_forecast_training_service`, schedules nightly training
- `bootstrap.py`: `LoadConsumptionModelRepository` wired in all three persistence branches (InMemory/SQLite/SQLAlchemy)

### Fixed
- Replaced latent `default_factory=Timestamp(datetime.now())` bugs (which froze a single timestamp at class-definition time) with the proper callable `utc_now_timestamp`, producing a fresh timestamp per instance
- **Braiins Pool adapter aligned to post-FPPS API schema** (`edge_mining/adapters/domain/performance/trackers/braiins_pool.py`): the adapter was reading pre-FPPS field names that were removed in the November 2023 migration, so `unpaid_balance`, worker `valid_shares`, `payout_schedule.threshold` and `payout_schedule.next_payout_at` were always `None` in the `DecisionalContext`. Mapping now follows the current schema:
  - `unpaid_balance` reads `current_balance` (previously `unconfirmed_reward`, removed upstream)
  - current-hashrate fallback chain uses `hash_rate_60m` (previously `hash_rate_1h`, which never existed)
  - `average_hashrate_7d` is left `None` (Braiins exposes only 24h/yesterday aggregates)
  - `PayoutSchedule` is now `DAILY` with `threshold=None` and `next_payout_at=None` (FPPS pays daily, threshold is no longer configurable)
  - Worker `valid_shares` maps to `shares_24h` (the only cumulative share metric exposed); `stale_shares`/`rejected_shares` stay `None` as Braiins doesn't surface them

  - Helper functions: `load_features_for_miner()`, `save_features_for_miner()`

  - `get_miner_details_from_controller()`: Return type changed from `Optional[Miner]` to `Optional[MinerStateSnapshot]`
  - `add_miner()`: Removed `status` parameter

- **Application Services**:
  - `MinerActionService` (`edge_mining/application/services/miner_action_service.py`): Refactored all methods to build and return `MinerStateSnapshot` instead of mutating/persisting the `Miner` entity state
  - `ConfigurationService` (`edge_mining/application/services/configuration_service.py`): Removed `status` from `add_miner()`
  - `OptimizationService` (`edge_mining/application/services/optimization_service.py`): Updated context building to create `MinerStateSnapshot` objects; removed `miner.turn_on()`/`miner.turn_off()` calls and state persistence after decisions

- **Rule Engine** (`edge_mining/adapters/infrastructure/rule_engine/schemas.py`):
  - Updated operator examples from `miner.status` to `miner_state.status`

- **YAML Rule Files** (`data/examples/rules/stop/`):
  - Updated `advanced_stop_rules.yaml` and `basic_stop_rules.yaml`: Changed field references from `miner.status` to `miner_state.status`

- **Alembic Migration** (`alembic/versions/4e55fe6113c7_initial_schema_with_all_tables.py`):
  - Removed columns `status`, `hash_rate`, `power_consumption` from `miners` table definition
  - Removed `MinerStatusType()` reference (custom type no longer exists)

- **WebSocket event handlers**: Refactored to use topic strings and return `WebSocketMessage` payloads; `broadcast_message()` updated to use `WebSocketMessage` type

- **`FORECAST_PROVIDER`** added to `ConfigurationUpdatedEventType` enum

### Fixed
- Fixed unterminated string literal in `MinerActionServiceInterface` docstring
- Fixed connection error handling for Home Assistant API with client reset and improved logging
- Fixed external service update logic to handle missing configuration classes
- Fixed database directory creation for SQLite connections when using SQLAlchemy persistence adapter
- Fixed critical error handling replaced with warnings for missing energy values in Home Assistant monitors
- Fixed missing import for sqlalchemy in migration script

## [Pre-Release]

### Added
- **Automatic Alembic Migrations**: Database migrations now run automatically on application startup
  - New module `edge_mining/adapters/infrastructure/persistence/sqlalchemy/migrations.py`
  - CLI tool `scripts/migrate.py` for manual migration management
  - Configuration option `RUN_MIGRATIONS_ON_STARTUP` in settings (default: true)
  - Commands: `status`, `upgrade`, `downgrade`, `create`, `history`
  - Method `initialize_database()` in `BaseSQLAlchemyRepository` that handles complete DB initialization

- **Documentation**:
  - `docs/ALEMBIC_MIGRATIONS.md` - Complete guide to migration system
  - `docs/MIGRATION_EXAMPLE.md` - Practical example of adding a field

- **Testing Infrastructure**:
  - **Unit Tests** (42 tests):
    - `tests/unit/adapters/domain/energy/test_tables_event_listeners.py` - Complete test suite for SQLAlchemy event listeners
    - Tests for `load` event listeners (EntityId, enum, and value object conversions from database)
    - Tests for `before_insert/update` event listeners (flattening composites before persistence)
    - Tests for `after_insert/update` event listeners (restoring composites after persistence)
    - Tests for configuration deserialization and value object round-trip conversion
  - **Integration Tests** (34 tests):
    - `tests/integration/adapters/persistence/test_sqlalchemy_energy_repositories.py` (21 tests) - Full CRUD operations with real database
    - `tests/integration/adapters/persistence/test_alembic_migrations.py` (9 tests) - Alembic migration system validation
    - `tests/integration/adapters/persistence/test_e2e_persistence.py` (8 tests) - End-to-end persistence workflows

### Changed
- **`BaseSQLAlchemyRepository`**:
  - Added `initialize_database()` method that encapsulates all database setup logic
  - Added `run_migrations` parameter to constructor
  - Improved separation of concerns by moving migration logic from bootstrap to repository
  - **BREAKING**: Removed `create_all_tables()` method - all schema changes must now go through Alembic migrations
  - Fail-fast approach: initialization fails clearly if migrations fail (no silent fallback)
- **SQLAlchemy Event Listeners** (`edge_mining/adapters/domain/energy/tables.py`):
  - Enhanced 4-phase conversion system for domain entities ↔ database mapping
  - `load` listeners: Convert database strings to EntityId, enums, and value objects
  - `before_insert/update` listeners: Flatten value objects to primitives before persistence
  - `after_insert/update` listeners: Restore EntityId, enums, and value objects after persistence
  - Added type ignore comments with explanatory notes for runtime type conversions
  - Fixed foreign key conversions (energy_monitor_id, forecast_provider_id, external_service_id)
- **`bootstrap.py`**: Simplified database initialization using `initialize_database()`
- **`alembic/env.py`**: Updated to use shared metadata registry from SQLAlchemy imperative mapping
- **`.env.example`**: Added migration configuration examples and multi-database support
- **`README.md`**: Added database migrations section with usage instructions
- **Settings**: Added `run_migrations_on_startup` configuration option

### Fixed
- Migration path calculation now correctly resolves project root
- Better error handling for migration failures with graceful fallback
- Improved encapsulation: database initialization logic moved to appropriate layer
- Fixed import error in `tests/unit/adapters/infrastructure/rule_engine/test_rule_evaluator.py` (OperatorType import path)
- SQLAlchemy event listeners now correctly handle all type conversions between domain and database layers
- EntityId conversions for primary keys and foreign keys (energy_monitor_id, forecast_provider_id, external_service_id)
- Enum conversions (EnergySourceType, EnergyMonitorAdapter) in both directions
- Value object conversions (Watts, Battery, Grid) with proper serialization/deserialization
